PERSONAL INFORMATION

I am a graduate student pursuing computer science at Northeastern University.
Previously i was working as a software engineer with Robert Bosch.
I have experience working in .NET technologies such as C# and C++ and 
web technologies such as ASP, XSL-FO etc.

I was involved in developing the following projects:

"FLOW5"
Customer: ROBERT BOSCH Gmbh.
Description
•	The project is being developed for the organization named Robert Bosch. The application is used by many departments as well as customers. 
•	The desktop application is developed for the automobile domain and used by various clients such as Volkswagen, BMW, Ferrari, Ford, Mercedes etc.
•	It is a workflow tool used to manage the various aspects of the process involved in flashing of ECU’s.
•	Modules are developed using various .NET technologies such as C#.NET, Com C++, VB.NET as well as Web Technologies such as HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT etc.
•	The users can create jobs where they can enter information about the ECU and the different teams involved with co-ordination, delivery etc. can work on it.
•	The users can export and import data in any format, attach files, generate mails and monitor all the aspects of ECU generation. 


Technology: C#. NET, VB.NET, COM C++, Web Technologies.
Tools: Visual Studio 2012, SQL Server 2012, Interop, Winwrap, Infragistics.

Responsibilities
•	Involved in the complete process of Requirement Analysis, Design, Coding and Testing.
•	Involved in development and release activities.
•	Writing UI/Business validations for general as well as customer specific use cases.
•	Unit testing and integration testing.
•	Maintenance and Support.
•	Perform configuration tasks such as creation of new user, ECU creation, Routing creation etc. with the help of database queries, stored procedures and C#, C++ code.
•	Hotline Handling and solving Issues faced by the user.

•	The application uses Microsoft Silverlight Framework for running the application on browsers.
•	The users can create jobs where they can enter information about the ECU and the different teams involved with preparation of the ECU, co-ordination, delivery etc. can work on it.
•	The users can export and import data in any format, attach files, generate mails, generate documents and monitor all the aspects of ECU generation. 


Technology: C#.NET, VB.NET, COM C++, Web Technologies, Microsoft Silverlight.
Tools: Visual Studio 2012, Oracle SQL developer, Apache FOP.

Responsibilities
•	Involved in the complete process of Requirement Analysis, Design, Coding and Testing.
•	Develop plugins for document generation in various formats from the tool using C#.NET, XSL-FO and Apache FOP.

"Business process integration and project monitoring system".
	Name of the Institute:      JSS Academy of Technical Education.
	Technology:                      ASP.NET, C#.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, SQL.
	Tools:                                Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Microsoft SQL Server 2012.
	Operating System:           Windows.
	Description:            The project demonstrates business process integration of several key business processes of an organization in the 
	Information technology Industry. This is done using schedulers implemented using stored procedures which implements pull and push mechanism 
	to pull data from one business process and push it into another. Thus exchange of data is automated thus reducing effort and saving time. 
	Project monitoring system looks after resource usage through billing activities and with the help of key performance indicators (KPI). 
	Algorithms are used calculate billing for the customers based on efforts entered in the timesheet and other parameters set for the projects. 
	Role based authorization is implemented using algorithms so that access and information is restricted to only the authorized personnel. 
	The algorithm matches the role and the user id and renders the appropriate content. A Customer Satisfaction Survey was also developed to 
	get the feedback from the clients after the projects are delivered.


"Simulation of dijkstra’s algorithm."
	Name of the Institute:   JSS Academy of Technical Education. 
	Technology:                  OpenGL 
	Operating System:       Ubuntu
	Description:             The project demonstrates the simulation dijkstra’s algorithm using Open GL functions. 
	The user inputs the data in the form of cost matrix and also specifies the source vertex. Each left click places the corresponding vertex on the screen.
	The display weighted graph option displays the edges along with the cost of each edge while the display shortest path option shows the shortest path between
	source and other vertices.



"Nexus Communication System" 
    done as a part of FOCAS technical workshop at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited
	Technology:                     C#.NET, SQL, ADO.NET, WPF.
	Tools:                                Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, Microsoft SQL Server 2012.
	Operating System:           Windows.
	Description:            The application was developed for a telecom company for managing its services.
	The application can be used to register new user as well as modify existing users. Before registering the users a feasibility check 
	is done based on an algorithm which calculates the distance between the address of the requestor, nearest regional office and the usage 
	statistics of that area. Various plans with different tariff can be created and managed. An algorithm is used to create the plans for maximum 
	profit based on the usage statistics of the given area. Bill can be generated and payment can be tracked with interest rate being added for defaulters.
